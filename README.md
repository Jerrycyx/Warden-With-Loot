# Warden-With-Loot

### Added lots of drops for Warden to make Warden's loot match its strength.

Warden is such a powerful boss, isn't it? Killing such a HUGE boss should result in some better loot rather than just a simple bullet satalyst. So this mod/datapack **added more than ten types of loot to Warden.**
