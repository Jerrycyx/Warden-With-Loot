## Overview

Finally, the Warden drops loot worthy of its reign! Shouldn't such a terrifying boss drop something more exciting than a single sculk catalyst? **This datapack/mod reimagines the Warden as a truly worthy boss by adding several advancements and over a dozen new drops to its loot table.**

Starting from version 3.0 (MC 1.20.2+), **all additional drops will be stored in 1-2 bundles**. **Additionally, the Warden will now drop loot equivalent to an Ancient City chest and a substantial amount (300) of experience points**.

## Notes:

+ Please ignore datapack version warning when the game version is under 1.20.2

+ This datapack changes dropped objects by directly overwriting the vanilla loot table, so **it may not be compatible with other mods that directly change the vanilla loot table**

+ Due to Minecraft 1.20.5's major NBT updates and item components implementation, **this datapack/mod will prioritize 1.20.5+ versions first, with potential delays for 1.20.4 and earlier**
